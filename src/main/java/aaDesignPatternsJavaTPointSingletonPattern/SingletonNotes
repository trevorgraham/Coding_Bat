SINGLETON

The Singleton design means that you "Define a class that has only one instance and provide a global
point of access to it".
There are two forms of this Early Instantiation (creation at load time) and Lazy Instantiation
(instance created when needed).

Advantages
Saves memory as only one item is created and used again and again

Usage
Single patterns are mostly used in multi-threaded and database applications. Used for logging,
caching, thread pools and configuration settings.

How to create
To create the singleton class, we need to have static member of class, private constructor and
static factory method.

Static member: It gets memory only once because of static, it contains the instance of the Singleton
class.
Private constructor: It will prevent to instantiate the Singleton class from outside the
class.
Static factory method: This provides the global point of access to the Singleton object and
returns the instance to the caller.
