Factory Method Pattern

The Factory method is also known as the Virtual Constructor Pattern - and is implemented by
defining an interface or abstract class for creating an object and letting its sub classes create
the instance of the class.

Advantages
1) Factory Method allows the sub classes to choose the type of objects to create

2) The Factory also promotes loose-coupling by eliminating the need to bind application-specific
classes in the code. The code interacts solely with the interface or abstract class, so will work
with any class that implements the interface or extends the abstract class.


When to use Factory Design Pattern
1)  when the class doesnt know what sub-classes it may be required to create
2)  when a class wants that its sub-classes specify the objects to be created
3)  when the parent classes choose the creation of objects for its sub-classes
