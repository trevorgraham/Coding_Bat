# Coding_Bat

This git Repo is to store my completed Coding Bat exercises when they have passed. The quality the examples will hopefully improve as I get to the later stages/ more advanced examples as I'm learning all the time. Hopefully when I've finished the Java Examples I'll redo them all in Python as that's the next language I want to study.
All the examples I've completed I've written JUnit tests for (rather than just relying on Coding Bats test).
